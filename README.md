# Goal
I am re-doing all of my old bootcamp assignments with a couple of goals in mind. First, I want to solidify the skills I learned in the bootcamp and start using React to build out projects. Next, I want to improve upon the first attempt meaning that I want to styling, UI, accessibility, etc., to be better overall. 

# Description
This is a simple random password generator app that will provide the user with a randomly generated password. I am using React to build the user interface, npm for my package manager, pure css for styling, and react.toastify package for message handling.

# User Story
As a user, I want a randomly generated password to keep my accounts safe.
As a user, I want my password to contain a combination of uppercase letters, lowercase letters and numbers.
As a user, I want my newly generated password to be copied to my clipboard for ease of use.
